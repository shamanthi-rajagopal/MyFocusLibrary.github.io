# MyFocusLibrary.github.io
Repository for My Focus Library Website Code. Created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

My Focus Library is a website that simulates a virtual library experience. Libraries have provided educational support to various people, especially students. As a university student myself, I wanted to give others a virtual library if, in any case, the actual library was not accessible to anyone. I plan to use this site whenever necessary. The project has taught me a lot about front-end and web development programming, and I have increased my skills with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Enjoy the website!
